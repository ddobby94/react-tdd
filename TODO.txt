- Create Wallet.js, which renders an input field with 2 buttons: DEPOSIT/ WITHDRAW
- Add <Wallet /> to the App.js.
- In <Wallet /> display the current balance from state.
- DEPOSIT/WITHDRAW buttons should change the current balance and add the current amount to the history.
- Create <WalletHistory /> to render the history.
- Add <WalletHistory /> to <Wallet />

Tests needed: 
- Check if App renders (it has the <Wallet />).
- Check if the <Wallet /> renders (it displays the current balance, has the buttons)
- Check if the input updates the state correctly
- Check if the DEPOSIT/WITHDRAW buttons works
- Check if the WalletHistory renders the history

Flow:
 - App.js
 - Wallet.js
 - WalletHistory.js
